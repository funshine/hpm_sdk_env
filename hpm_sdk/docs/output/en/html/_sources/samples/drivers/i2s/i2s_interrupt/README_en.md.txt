# I2S Interrupt

## Overview

This example shows I2S transfer audio data with Interrupt way to audio codec on board.

## Project Configuration

- In the file `CMakeLists.txt`, set a matched audio codec type according to the development board schematicï¼Œe.g. "set(CONFIG_CODEC "sgtl5000")"

## Board Setting

- Connect headphone to the [headphone](lab_board_app_headphone) interface on the audio codec chip.

## Known Issue

- When using the headphone interface of Codec to play audio on some development boards, there may be crosstalk. For example, when playing mono audio through the left channel of the headphone, weak sound can be heard on the right channel headphone.
